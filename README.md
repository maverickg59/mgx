# MotoGX

MotoGX is a peer to peer marketplace developed to centralize the used gear and motorcycle parts market that allows users to buy or upload and sell new and used items. The code contained in this repo is not the most up to date code for this project. My most recent code is located in a private repo and can be made available during an interview if necessary.
